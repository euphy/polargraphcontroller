polargraphcontroller
====================

Polargraph controller
Copyright Sandy Noble 2015.

- Requires the excellent ControlP5 GUI library available from https://github.com/sojamo/controlp5.
- Requires the excellent Geomerative library available from http://www.ricardmarxer.com/geomerative/.
- Running on Processing v2.2.1.

This is a desktop application for controlling a polargraph machine, communicating using ASCII command language over a serial link.

The [latest releases bundle] (https://github.com/euphy/polargraphcontroller/releases/latest) contains 
copies of all the libraries that I use, as well as all the source, and compiled versions of the code where sensible.
