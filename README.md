====================

Polargraph controller
Copyright Sandy Noble 2014.

- Requires v0.5.4 of the excellent ControlP5 GUI library available from http://www.sojamo.de/libraries/controlP5/ 
  - (http://code.google.com/p/controlp5/downloads/detail?name=controlP5_0.5.4.zip&can=2&q=).
- Requires the excellent Geomerative library available from http://www.ricardmarxer.com/geomerative/.
- Currently only runs on Processing v1.5

This is a desktop application for controlling a polargraph machine, communicating using ASCII command language over a serial link.

Very sorry that this doesn't work with newest versions of the libraries and Processing.

The [latest releases bundle] (https://github.com/euphy/polargraphcontroller/releases/latest) contains 
copies of all the libraries that I use, as well as all the source, and compiled versions of the code where sensible.

This project (polargraphcontroller) is the "owner" of the bundle, in that bundle releases show up as events against this project. But not every bundle release actually includes an update from polargraphcontroller, but still requires one to keep the release sequence in order. So there's some fake changes. Just be chill.
